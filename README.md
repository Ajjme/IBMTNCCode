# IBM TNC Code
We are working with IBM and the Nature Conservancy to create an open water database that will help stakeholders in Kenyaâ€™s Tana River better manage their water. We are using Python, SQL, and R to do spatial and statistical analyses of the water availability. This area of Kenya is particularly vulnerable to climate change and our database will incorporate tools and recommendations about how best to plan for the future.  we are also utilizing this data to create reports for the local population, to help them better understand, and plan for the effects of climate change without the need for the internet, or an academic background. Project through UCLA's IOES
